This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global Consumer Price Index (CPI) trends and inflation patterns across various regions. By leveraging data analysis techniques, SQL queries, and data visualization tools, the project delivers actionable insights into economic conditions and inflation dynamics.

**Â Features**
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
Loaded the Consumer Price Index (CPI) dataset in CSV format.
Reshaped the dataset into a long format for enhanced data manipulation.
Handled missing values and ensured proper data type conversions.
2. Inflation Rate Calculation
Computed inflation rates for each region based on CPI changes.
Addressed infinite and missing values in inflation rates.
3. Data Storage and Querying
Saved cleaned data in a CSV file for further analysis.
Stored data in an SQLite database to enable complex SQL queries, such as:
Regions with the highest average CPI.
Regions with the highest inflation rates.
Average CPI trends by date and region.
4. Statistical Analysis
Performed statistical correlation analysis between CPI and inflation rate.
5. Data Visualization
The project includes the following visualizations:
Line Plot: CPI trends over time for selected regions.
Box Plot: Inflation rates distribution across regions.
Heatmap: CPI trends across regions and time.
Scatter Plot: Relationship between CPI and inflation rate.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sqlite3, scipy
Database: SQLite

Insights Derived:
Average CPI by Region: Identified regions with the highest average CPI.
Inflation Patterns: Highlighted regions with the highest inflation rates.
Trends Visualization: Visualized global CPI and inflation patterns over time.
Correlation Analysis: Assessed the relationship between CPI and inflation rate.
